We stumbled upon a clearing, a small patch of sunlit grass surrounded by towering trees. In the center of the clearing stood a single, solitary oak tree, its branches reaching up towards the sky like the outstretched arms of an old friend. It was a beautiful sight, and we felt drawn to it in a way that was almost magnetic.\n\nAs we approached the oak tree, a strange sense of peace settled over us. It was as if we had finally found a place where we truly belonged, a place where we could be ourselves without fear or hesitation. And then, without warning, it happened. We felt a sharp pain in our chest, a sudden tightness that left us gasping for breath. And then, just like that, it was over.\n\nWe collapsed to the ground, our vision blurring and fading as the world spun around us. We could hear the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze, the distant cries of birds in the treetops. But it all seemed so far away, so distant and unreal. And then, with a final, shuddering breath, we let go.\n\nAnd so, in answer to the question - where didus die? We died in the forest, under the watchful gaze of the ancient oak tree.
