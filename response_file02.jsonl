Steam reforming: Labs can also produce hydrogen gas by reacting steam (water vapor) with a hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas or methane, in the presence of a catalyst at high temperatures. This reaction produces hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide.\n\n3. Chemical reactions: Labs can also produce hydrogen gas through various chemical reactions, such as reacting a metal with an acid (e.g. magnesium with hydrochloric acid), or reacting a metal hydride with water.\n\n4. Biological processes: Labs can also produce hydrogen gas using biological processes, such as fermenting organic matter (e.g. biomass or wastewater) using bacteria that produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct.\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, cost, and environmental impact, so labs may choose different methods depending on their specific needs and constraints.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 14, "completion_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 262, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}
